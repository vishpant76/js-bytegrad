## Fancy Counter Project

### HTML & CSS Part

- Font used - "Inter" from google fonts.
- [For icons](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome)
- [Why 'defer' is recommended in script tag](https://chat.openai.com/share/3e3d771f-a146-4c12-b35d-ac294f0bb0fd)  - This ensures that the script waits until the HTML has been parsed before getting executed.
- HTML/CSS was not very clear. There are many things I have yet to learn: when to change flex direction, using external fonts, nesting multiple flexboxes (when to do that), media queries, etc. The finished HTML/CSS when rendered, did not display the counter buttons properly.. Still not sure why as the code is identical to the course code. That code is saved in the *-practice files (html/css). may be for now, only focus on the JS linking part and come back to HTML/CSS structuring later.
